#HappyDevWebsite

The repository name is self-explainatory, the is the repository for the happy-dev organization website code.
The goal of this repository is to collaboratively work on interfacing the ldp-framework for manipulating Linked Data with the D3JS library for presenting the information as nodes and links between them.

The base code of the fluidgraph library by fluidlog (https://github.com/fluidlog/fluidgraph )will probably be used (at least tested).

So, getting back to work ;-)
